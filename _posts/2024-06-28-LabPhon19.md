I attended LabPhon19 in Seoul to present my poster "Creaky voice variation across language and gender in Canadian English-French bilingual speech". Here are some pictures from the conference!

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/LabPhon19_1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/LabPhon19_2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/LabPhon19_3.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

This was also my first trip out of Canada, and I had always wanted to visit South Korea! Here are some of the pictures I took travelling around Seoul:
