I attended [moth]2025 (phonology/phonetics workshop), hosted by the University of Toronto from April 4-5, to present my talk "Gender and age effects of creaky voice acoustics: Mediation by f0". This work was the result of a semester's work in LING683. Here are some pictures from the conference!

Wandering around Toronto (post conference) for a weekend was fun! Here are some of the pictures I took:

I also attended CLA 2025 at McGill University June 3-5 (my first CLA!) and presented my talk "Acoustic correlates in the production of creaky voice: Mediation by f0". My friend (and McGill alum), Claire, was able to visit and also present at CLA.
