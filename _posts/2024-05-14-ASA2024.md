I went back to Ottawa for ASA2024 (May 13-17) to present my poster "Creaky voice across language, gender and age: A study of Canadian English-French bilingual speech" (joint work with Morgan Sonderegger). Ottawa's tulip season is the best! Here are some pictures from the conference and around downtown.
