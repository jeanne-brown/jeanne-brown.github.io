I successfully completed my 2nd comprehensive evaluation paper and am officially ABD!
I have submitted my manuscript, [Disentangling acoustic and social biases in creaky voice perception: The effects of f0 and face gender on creakiness ratings](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/5j42b_v1) (joint with Meghan Clayards), for publication, and the preprint is now available.
